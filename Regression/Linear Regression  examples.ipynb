    "\n",
    "Steps involved : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing libraries : \n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "%matplotlib inline\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importing the Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading the dataset of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "dataset = pd.read_csv('D:\\Datasets\\student_scores.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploration of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "dataset.shape - details of the rows and columns\n",
    "dataset.head() - you can choose how many records you'd like to see\n",
    "dataset.describe()- statistical details of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simple plotting of the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "dataset.plot(x='Hours', y='Scores', style='o')\n",
    "plt.title('Hours vs Percentage')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Percentage Score')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : In the script above, we use plot() function of the pandas dataframe and pass it the column names for x coordinate and y coordinate, which are \"Hours\" and \"Scores\" respectively.\n",
    "NB: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Preparing the Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The data needs to be divided into attributes ( independent) and labels ( dependent variables to be predicted ) . \n",
    "To extract the attributes , we use : \n",
    "\n",
    "X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values\n",
    "y = dataset.iloc[:, 1].values\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes stored in X variable , -1 is the range for columns and Y stores the labels, 1 for the range of scores ( in column 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Next is to split the data into training and test sets using scikit learn built in train_tes_split() method : \n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This splits 80 % of the data to the training set and 20 % to the test set * 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Training the Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "regressor = LinearRegression()\n",
    "regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear regression model basically finds the best value for the intercept and slope which results in the best line fit the data. this calculated using the following code : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "to retrieve the intercept:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(regressor.intercept_)\n",
    "The resulting value you see should be approximately 2.01816004143.\n",
    "\n",
    "For retrieving the slope (coefficient of x):\n",
    "\n",
    "print(regressor.coef_)\n",
    "The result should be approximately 9.91065648.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation : for one unit change in hours studied , the change in score is about 9.9%. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Making Predictions \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use the trained algorithm to make some predictions using the etst data and see how the algorithm predicts the precentage score. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "The y_pred is a numpy array that contains all the predicted values for the input values in the X_test series.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the actual output values for X_test with the predicted values, execute the following script:\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})\n",
    "df\n",
    "\n",
    "Though our model is not very precise, the predicted percentages are close to the actual ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the columns above may be different in your case because the train_test_split function randomly splits data into train and test sets, and your splits are likely different from the one shown in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Evaluating the Algorithm  : \n",
    "\n",
    "Important to compare how well the different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For regression algorithms , there are three evaluation metrics used : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the Algorithm\n",
    "The final step is to evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For regression algorithms, three evaluation metrics are commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors. It is calculated as:\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors and is calculated as:\n",
    "Mean Squared Error\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error\n",
    "Luckily, we don't have to perform these calculations manually. The Scikit-Learn library comes with pre-built functions that can be used to find out these values for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the values for these metrics using our test data. Execute the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn import metrics\n",
    "print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))\n",
    "The output will look similar to this (but probably slightly different):\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error: 4.183859899\n",
    "Mean Squared Error: 21.5987693072\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error: 4.6474476121\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the value of root mean squared error is 4.64, which is less than 10% of the mean value of the percentages of all the students i.e. 51.48. This means that our algorithm did a decent job."
