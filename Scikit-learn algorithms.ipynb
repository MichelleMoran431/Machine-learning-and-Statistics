    "## Random Forest model:##\n",
    "Random forest is a supervised ensemble learning algorithm that is used for both classifications as well as regression problems. But however, it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees mean more robust forests. Similarly, the random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects the best solution by means of voting.\n",
    "It is an ensemble method that is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.\n",
    "Why Random?ðŸ¤”\n",
    "In the Random Forest model, random represents two features, one is a random sampling of training data set whole building trees and the other is random subsets of features considered when splitting nodes.\n",
    "How the Algorithm works?\n",
    "It involves four steps:\n",
    "Step-1: Select random samples from a given dataset.\n",
    "Step-2: Construct a decision tree for each sample and get a prediction result from each decision tree.\n",
    "Step-3: Perform a vote for each predicted result.\n",
    "Step-4: Select the prediction result with the most votes as the final prediction.\n",
