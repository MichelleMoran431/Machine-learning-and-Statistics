    "1. Has functions for both Discrete and Continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Descriptive Statistical values - the values of observation in a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Different types of distributions such as :\n",
    "\n",
    "        .  Uniform ( continous or discrete )-  distribution describes an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain parameters or  \"discrete uniform distribution\" would be \"a known, finite number of outcomes equally likely to happen\".\n",
    "       . Continuous - A probability distribution in which the random variable X can take on any value (is continuous)\n",
    "       . Binomial -distribution type that has two possible outcomes e.g, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or   tails \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Perform T-tests on data to evaluate the difference between the mean (average) values of two arrays.\n",

    "SciPy Stats consists of the following three generic base classes:\n",

    "1. rv_continuous\n",

    " - construction of a specific distribution sub-classes and instances for continuous random variables. It can take any value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. rv_discrete\n",
    "\n",
    " - construction of a specific distribution sub-classes and instances for discrete random variables.Example distribution of this would be bionmial \n",
    "\n",
    "3. rv_histogram\n",
    "  - used  to generate specific distribution histograms. It can also be inherited from the class.\n",
