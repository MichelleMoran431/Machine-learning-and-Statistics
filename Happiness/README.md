###**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this assessment to demonstrate a learning of the module and to create sample work to show prospective employers. The overall assessment is split into 3 components: 

### **Part 1

 - GitHub Respository containing : 
     - README.md - details the respository  , why it exists , whats in it , and how to run the notebooks
     - requirements.txt- enabling any person to run my notebooks efficiently

### **Part 2
 - SciKit- Learn Jupyter Notebook - called scikit-learn.ipynb
     - clear and concise overview of scikit-learn python library
     - Demonstrations of 3 interesting scikit- learn algorithms
     - Plots and other visualisations of the above
     
### **Part3
 - Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook - scipy-stats-ipynb:
     - Clear and concise overview of scipy- stats python library
     - An example hypothesis test using ANOVA 
         - Find a dataset to use ANOVA ensureing the assumptions underlying ANOVE are met 
         - Perform and display the results of ANOVA using scipy-stats
     - PLots and other visualisations of the above


###**Getting started**

Download and install Python and Anaconda, all files associated with this project are available at **git@github.com:g00387856/Machine-learning-and-Statistics.git**

###**Packages used in this project**

The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and draw grpahs for this project.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.
Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.
Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text
import pandas as pd https://pandas.pydata.org/
import scipy.stats as stats https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html - module contains a large number of probability distributions as well as a growing library of statistical functions.
import matplotlib.pylab as plt https://matplotlib.org/ - is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations in Python.
from sklearn.model_selection import ....https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ - is a simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

### **PART 1 Contents of Github Repository**

1.README file

### **PART 2 - SciKit- Learn Jupyter

Contents :

 - Overview of the Scikit-Learn Python Library ##
 - Dataset : The World Happiness Report
 
#### Machine Learning SETUP:

    Step 1 :Importing Packages¶
    Step 2. Read in the Dataset¶
    Step 3 :PERFORMING EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
    Step 3 :PERFORM DATA VISUALIZATION¶
    Step 4 :Data Preparation and preproccessing
    Step 5 :Scaling of the data : Standardization

3 Examples of Algorithms : 
    1. SciKit-Learn Algorithm - K- Means Clustering¶
    2.SciKit-Learn Algorithm - KNN
        -Plotting the Fit of Your Model¶
        - Tune and Optimize kNN in Python Using scikit-learn
        - Adding Weighted Average of Neighbors Based on Distance
        - Further Improving on kNN in scikit-learn With Bagging
    3.SciKit-Learn Algorithm - Linear Regression
        -Import the packages and classes you need.
        -Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.
        - Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
        - Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
        - Apply the model for predictions.
